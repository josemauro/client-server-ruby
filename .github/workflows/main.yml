After this date, only critical patches (security and core bug fixes) will be accepted, and the project will be in "critical-only" mode for another six months (until November 30, 2021). This issue will be analyzed and manually reopened by our team if classified as critical. For more information visit this FAQ. We'll have eternal gratitude to the entire community of developers and users that made the project so far. " # optional property
